# Budgetr

## Overview
I developed this single page budget planning app as an exercise on using React/Redux.
Also included is an implementation of [Charts.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)

[Working Demo](https://lc-budgeting-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Local Installation & Setup
1. install a local copy, fork and clone this repository, i.e. `git clone https://github.com/larrycustodio/redux-budget-tracker.git budgtr`
2. After cloning the repo, install all npm dependendies by typing in `npm install` on the local terminal.
3. Transpile the code on the client-side by typing in `npm run build` on the local terminal. On success, webpack will generate a bundle.js and bundle.css files 
for the JS- and CSS- rendering, accordingly. Optionally, you can keep this instance of the terminal open to watch for changes. 
4. Open up a new instance of the terminal window, and type in `npm run start`. The app should be viewable on the browser at **http://localhost:3000**
