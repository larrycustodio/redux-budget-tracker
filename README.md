# Budgetr
[Working Demo](https://lc-budgeting-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
I developed this single page budget planning app as an exercise on client side state management using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

Also included is an implementation of [Charts.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)

## Local Installation & Setup
1. Install a local copy by forking or cloning this repository on a local directory, i.e. `git clone https://github.com/larrycustodio/redux-budget-tracker.git budgtr`
2. After cloning the repo, install all npm dependendies by typing in `npm install` on the local terminal.
3. Transpile the code on the client-side by typing in `npm run build` on the local terminal. On success, webpack will generate a bundle.js and bundle.css files 
for JS- and CSS- rendering, accordingly. Optionally, you can keep this instance of the terminal open to watch for changes. 
4. (OPTIONAL: Open up a new instance of the terminal window) Type in `npm run start`, and  working version of the app should be viewable at **http://localhost:3000**
